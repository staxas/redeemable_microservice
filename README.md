###Endpoints and their methods

##### GET /api/redeemables

Get all redeemables database entries.

##### POST /api/redeemables

Create a redeemable with a unique code. The payload is expected to contain a property named *assigned_specs* which contains either a string or an array of strings which are the properties to be redeemed (i.e. *50_percent_off* etcetera).
Also the payload can optionally contain an expiration date in either months, days or hours. Payload should then contain a property (number type) of either *expiration.months*, *expiration.days* or *expiration.hours*. Response is the unique 7 character alphanumeric code.

##### GET /api/redeemables/{code}

Search for a specific redeemable code, and if it is available (i.e. not yet redeemed) and not expired, return its *assigned_specs* database entry data (array type). Code is then subsequentially set to *redeemed* in the database, and is from then on no longer redeemable. Codes which are found to be expired are set to *expired*.

##### PATCH /api/redeemables/{code}

Needs to be implemented. Change properties associated with existing code

##### DELETE /api/redeemables/{code}

Needs to be implemented. Delete redeemable from the database
